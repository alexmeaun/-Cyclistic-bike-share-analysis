Step 3: Process

Data appears to be clean, so I'll proceed directly to manipulating it in order to get some insights.


I created a hierarichal foldering system. In "Cyclistic" folder, are 2 folders, "CSV" which contains the data from the 12 months in csv type, and a "XLS" folder that 
will contain the same data in xls format.
Created a new column "ride_length" where will be stored data about the lengths of each ride by subtracting the column "started_at" from the column "ended_at" and
applied format cells on the result to get how much did the riders used the bikes. 
Applied conditional formatting to differentiate between weekdays and weekend days.
Applied COUTIF to count the weekdays and weekend days.
Applied SUMIF to find out the total time (in minutes) ridden by a casual or member rider.
