Step 6: Act

Based on the average ride length of rider type per weekday, there can be clearly noticed that the average length of the casual riders is ways longer than that of the
members. The longest ride length of casual riders is on Friday, and lowest being on Monday. The average time ranges between 3581 and 3773. On the other hand, when it 
comes to members, there can be seen that on weekdays, they use bikes on a regular basis as a transportation to get from home to most likely seems to be work or an 
educational institution. This conclusion was made based on the fact that the average length is more or less the same during weekdays and then slightly increases. 
My conclusion is that casual riders use bike's far more than members do, about more than 3 times.

This information might serve as an insight to the team in terms of demand among casual riders. The numbers clearly are telling that casual riders are in need of the
bikes to offer them mobility. Now the question is why they are not buying the annual membership. 

Recommendations based on the obtained insights:
1. Investigate the pricing catalog and create new offers.
2. Survey casual riders in the 70th percentile in order to find out why they do not buy annual membership.
3. Make a deeper analysis where data about age and gender will be taken into consideration.
