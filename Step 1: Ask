Step 1 in data analysis: Ask

Team goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

Three questions that need to be answered in order to guide the team:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I was assigned with the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Questions that need to be asked in order to get a better understanding of the problem that needs to be solved:
1. What is the problem I am trying to solve here?
2. How can my findings help make data-driven decisions?
3. Who are the stakeholders?

Task:
1. What are stakeholders' objectives.
2. Identify a clear statement of the business task.

Delivering the task results:
Stakeholders are Lily Moreno (director of marketing and my manager), Cyclistic executive team (executive team that decides to approve our recommended plan), and 
Cyclistic marketing analytics team (people I'm working with). Their objective is to get the most efficient and well-planned marketing strategy which will provide
insights which will allow to make data-driven decisions. Business task is to study the data regarding casual riders and annual members and find the similarities and
differencies. Studying all the aspects that data can provide me, I'll be able to notice a pattern and make decisions from that.
